                                Hi there, thank for visiting my space :D, let me introduce myself a little bit.

                            <br> 
                             my name is Quang, Phuoc Quang, I'm a very very junior front-end developer, familiar with JS stacks, work better on reactjs and still noob on nodejs.
                            <br>
                            I feel like I'm a "<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multipotentiality">multipotentialite</a>", I follow everything appear in my head, feel interesting and excited, sometime guitar, some time skateboard, history research, cyber security, hacking, linux, ..., in short, I'm a guy like everything, noob everything.
                            <br>
                            A bit about my works, I've worked as a front end developer for 1 year and half, first in insurance industry, now is human resources, 1.5 year to me just a number, there are still a lot of stuffs need to learn.
                            <br>
                            And this time, I focus on learning, trying to learn everyday to improve my knowledges, then apply for a job as a front-end or full-stack developer.                        
                            <br>

                                    I joined an in-house project and few months later, I worked like a solo player, main role was update UI following requiments, create some google app script apps, ...
                                    <br> 
                                    Few months gone, I felt like my skills is not enough and I was not contribute to company well, so I decided to leave and started learning, trying to be better before going to get a new job.

                                    I must say this is very very lucky, I got my first job ever, as a intern front end developer, after 3 months probation, I passed, then I have a chance to join a team and worked on an Insurtech project.
                                    <br>
                                    About my team, this is a team I'll never forget, everyone is very funny, leader and teammate always supportive and like to share their knowledge, we also have a english time to talk to others, my teamlead was also open for me opportunities to worked on weird tasks to improve my skills, most of time I failed, but I always learn something new from it.

                                <p class="description">
                                    I was a freshmen in Cao Thang College that year, my major was Network Administrator.
                                    <br />
                                    After one year studied in college, luckily I found for myself something interesting - programming.
                                    <br>
                                    Back in the day few years ago, in the evening of May 2019, I was playing game too much, and just some thought appeared in my head, I was confused for a while, didn't know what I'm doing for my life, so I sit down, do some research about my major, about IT, and then I found a "thing" called web development, it sounds good :D, so I started my journey, first with HTML.
                                    <br />
                                    And after half year of searching and self-taught, I found out that College is not fit me anymore, so I decided to quit,...
                                    <br />
                                    That's how my "lucky", "dumb" and "magic" journey begin!

                                        Last time I worked on it, it was a big update, changed almost everything, using HTML, SCSS and some third parties.

                                        The hard part of this I faced was about the design, it was very detail, every pixel must be right in its place, it took me a bunch of times to get it done, but, I learn a lot that time.
